<p> I used to love reading as a child, staying up late to devour the next Harry Potter book, or whatever comic I could get my hand on.  Over time due to my illness reading became much harder as my eyesight began to wane and there was only so much I could do with a kindle and magnifying glasses when it came to reading.  Thankfully, one day my brother reccomended me the app called "Libby" which has changed my life for the better ever since.  This app allows you to connect to any public library in the world, and most large scale public libraries also have licensing to allow patrons to borrow audiobooks.  Ever since I have found out about the app I have been devouring books nonstop, reading a book almost every 10 days, at the gym, on a walk with my dog or while taking the bus.  It's allowed me to discover and read a wide range of topics, from city infrastrucre and planning to how building a stronger community in a city can help reduce illness, cut costs on the city budget and build bonds across age, race and religon.  </p>
 
 <p> The great thing about using the toronto Public Library as well is that it's all free, with helpful and friendly staff members who are more than happy to reccomend or help you find any type of book you may be interested in. </p>
