<p> One of my favorite philosophies imparted by Michael Pollen from his many books was that people should be able
to eat what they want to eat, have an extra scoop of ice cream or that 3rd slice of pizza.  However, if you are going to eat all this, you
must be able to make it yourself.  It's something that I try to live by in my life and 
I think it has gotten me pretty far in the kitchen.  It's allowed me to gain a wider appreciation for 
foods all around the world and helped me improve my culinary skills.</p>

  <p> I love being able to cook for my friends and family, half the time it feels like I can 
  just force whatever recipe I  want and most people will gladly take it.
    But another thing I like is imparting recipes on other people and having them share theirs with me.
    I've found over the years there's a myriad of benefits to cooking and baking, and below I've been able to compile a small
    list of some of the things I've learned /p>

<ul> 
<li>Cheaper than going out to eat, most of what you're paying for is in the presentation anyway</li>
<li> A valuable Skill that can be passed from one generation to the next, passing down family recipes and traits</li>
<li>Impress your friends and family with the most basic of cooking skills</li>
<li> Your transportation is powered by you, the harder you pedal the faster you can get there</li> </ul>
