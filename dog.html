<h1 class - "headings2">Dog Training</h1>

<p> This isn't something that I do for a living, but when I got my rescue dog ~5 years ago she was quite a handful.  She didn't like men, tall people or deep voices (but for some reason she liked me.  I took it upon myself to do everything in my power to help with her seperation anxiety, fearfullness, aggression and overall hyperacticity.  It's been a long Journey and she still has her moments, but she's definitly come a long way since I first rescued her.</p>
