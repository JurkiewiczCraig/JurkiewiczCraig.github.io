<p> This isn't something that I do for a living, 
 but when I got my rescue dog ~5 years ago she was quite a handful.
 She didn't like men, tall people or deep voices (but for some reason she liked me. 
 I took it upon myself to do everything in my power to help with her seperation anxiety, 
 fearfullness, aggression and overall hyperacticity.  It's been a long Journey and she still has her moments, but she's definitly come a long way since I first rescued her.</p>

 One of the first things I usually tell people when it comes to dog training is to avoid Cesar Milan at all costs, 
 the man is a celebrity dog trainer who uses outdated and almost barbaric practices when it comes to dog training and has caused multiple injuries and 
 even some deaths when it came to his trianing techniques.  It would be better to look at experts in the field of animal/dog psychology
 and look into Dr. Sophia Yinn, Dr. Ian Dunbar or Dr. Al;exandra Horowitz when it comes to traininginstead </p>
