<h1> The Most Efficent Form of Travel</h1>

<p> Cycling is becoming a more and more efficient form of Travel these days, with more and more cities building up bike lanes.  Price of gas and cars becoming exhorborant and more people looking for ways to workout without taking too much time out of their day.  Cycling around the city for work and other errands is slowly becoming more popular and efficent for every day people.  </p>
<p>  When I was living in Guelph for 18 months during the COVID-19 lockdown, one of my favourite pastimes was cycling aroudn the city, getting errands done and seeing all the sights and trails that were available to me.  Whenever I look back I begin to realize that if this was in a car there would be no way I could afford the gas, insurance and car payments all the whlie paying for rents groceries and other bills<p>

<ul> <li>Great exercise for getting blood to the knees</li>
<li> Saves taxpayers on road infrastrucutre- less heavy cars/trucks on the road means less road repairs</li>
<li>Significantly Cheaper than repairing a car, most repairs can be done without having to hand over $$$ to a auto shop to get it fixed</li>
<li> Your transportation is powered by you, the harder you pedal the faster you can get there</li>
